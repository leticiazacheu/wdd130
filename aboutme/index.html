      Hi everyone! My name is Leticia. I’m originally from Brazil, but I’ve been
      living in the U.S. for about eight years now. My parents and three of my
      siblings live here in Utah, but I still have an older sister back in
      Brazil, and I miss her so much. I’m majoring in Computer Science, and I
      work in IT here in Utah. It’s been a great way to gain experience while
      I’m finishing school and working toward my goal of becoming a software
      engineer. </p>
    <p>Between work and school, I don’t have much free time, but when I
      do, I love playing volleyball, drawing, and dancing. I also enjoy watching
      movies and shows. </p>
      One of the things I love most about BYU-Idaho is the opportunity that I have to get a degree online. 
      It's been a great experience so far, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this program.</p>
